# Genesis V2

**One-command app creation** using Nuxt + Claude Code integration

## What Genesis V2 Does

Genesis creates a complete, working Nuxt 3 app automatically using AI. **No manual steps, no configuration** - just describe what you want and get a fully built app.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g genesis
```

## Usage

```bash
# One command creates AND builds your entire app
genesis my-store "E-commerce store for handmade jewelry"

# Wait a few minutes while AI builds your app...
# âœ“ Nuxt app created
# âœ“ Nuxt UI added  
# âœ“ AI context generated
# âœ“ Claude Code ready
# âœ“ App built successfully

cd my-store
npm run dev
# Your complete app is ready! ðŸŽ‰
```

## How It Works

1. **Creates Nuxt 3 app** with `npx nuxi init`
2. **Adds Nuxt UI** with `npx nuxi module add ui`  
3. **Generates README.md** with your app description
4. **Generates DEVELOPMENT.md** with Nuxt UI best practices
5. **Installs Claude Code** (if not already installed)
6. **Auto-builds the app** using Claude Code with intelligent prompts

## What You Get

A **complete, working application** with:
- Modern homepage with hero section
- Main functionality as described
- Proper navigation and routing  
- Nuxt UI components throughout
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Best practices and clean code

## Examples

```bash
# E-commerce store
genesis jewelry-store "E-commerce for handmade jewelry with custom sizing"

# SaaS application  
genesis project-tool "Project management tool for small teams with kanban boards"

# Blog platform
genesis tech-blog "Technical blog with article creation and comment system"

# Each creates a complete, working app automatically
```

## Continue Development

After Genesis builds your app, continue enhancing it:

```bash
cd my-app
claude "add user authentication with login/signup"
claude "implement payment processing with Stripe"
claude "add admin dashboard for content management"
```

## Why This Approach Works

- **No templates to maintain** - AI generates fresh, modern code
- **No configuration hell** - Works with Nuxt + Nuxt UI defaults  
- **Always up-to-date** - Uses latest best practices
- **Complete applications** - Not just scaffolding, but working apps
- **AI-driven development** - Intelligent code generation and implementation

## Architecture

```
genesis/
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/genesis.js           # CLI entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js            # Main creation + Claude integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ readme-generator.js # Generates project context
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ development-generator.js # Generates dev guidelines
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

**Result:** One command = Complete working app ðŸš€
