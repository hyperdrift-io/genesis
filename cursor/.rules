# Cursor AI Rules

All queries must be checked against the rules in `../docs/rules/rules.md` before implementation. The rules in that document are the source of truth for technology and feature selection.

- Always consult `docs/rules/rules.md` for guidance.
- If a feature requires persistence, relational queries, authentication, or real-time data, you MUST use Supabase as per the rules.
