# Genesis

A hyperdrift app creation tool that generates complete web applications from a single prompt.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genesis.git
   cd genesis
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Usage

Create a new application by running the genesis script with a name and description:

```bash
# Using the Python script directly
python genesis.py my-app --description "A blog application with users, posts, and comments"

# If you made the script executable
./genesis.py my-app --description "A task management app with categories and priority levels"
```

Genesis will analyze your description, identify entities and features, and generate a complete web application scaffold.

## Features

- Single prompt app generation
- React template with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4
- Entity and feature detection from text descriptions
- Automatic app scaffolding with proper file structure
- Beautiful UI with shadcn/ui components and Lucide icons
- Local-first approach by default with progressive enhancement
- Supabase integration when persistence and authentication are needed

## UI Components

Genesis generates applications with a beautiful UI out of the box using:

- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Latest version with simplified configuration
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality, customizable UI components  
- **Lucide Icons**: Beautiful and consistent icon set
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts for all screens

All components are fully typed, accessible, and follow best practices.

## Local-First Development

Genesis follows a "local-first" approach by default:

1. Applications start with in-memory or localStorage persistence
2. UI/UX can be developed quickly without backend dependencies
3. Cursor rules help transition to Supabase when server persistence is needed
4. The API interface remains consistent during the transition

### Using Cursor Rules for Progressive Enhancement

When your application needs server persistence, look for special cursor rule comments in your code:

```typescript
// CURSOR_RULE: REPLACE_WITH_SUPABASE when persistence is needed
```

These markers indicate where code should be updated when adding database persistence.

## Project Structure

The generated project follows a standard structure:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app/           # Next.js App Router
│   ├── components/    # Reusable React components
│   │   └── ui/        # shadcn/ui components
│   ├── lib/           # Utility functions
│   ├── services/      # API service layer
│   ├── store/         # State management with Zustand

├── public/            # Static assets
├── package.json       # Dependencies and scripts
└── genesis.json       # App specification generated by Genesis
```

## Extending Genesis

You can extend Genesis by:

1. Adding new templates for different tech stacks
2. Enhancing the prompt analyzer to detect more entities
3. Creating new feature implementations
4. Adding more cursor rules for progressive enhancement
5. Expanding the pattern matching for entity detection
6. Adding more shadcn/ui components to the template
