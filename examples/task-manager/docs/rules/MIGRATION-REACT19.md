# React 19 Migration Guide

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the Task Manager application to React 19 and remove Supabase dependencies.

## Package Changes

The following changes were made to package.json:

1. Updated React to version 19:
   - `react` updated from `^18.3.1` to `^19.0.0`
   - `react-dom` updated from `^18.3.1` to `^19.0.0`

2. Added React 19 compatibility override:
   ```json
   "overrides": {
     "react-is": "^19.0.0"
   }
   ```

3. Removed Supabase dependency:
   - Removed `@supabase/supabase-js`

## File Structure Changes

1. Moved development guide:
   - Moved `DEV-GUIDE.md` to `docs/rules/DEV-GUIDE.md` with updated content

2. Created new cursor rules:
   - Added `.cursor/rules.MD` that points to documentation in `docs/rules`
   - Removed `.cursorrules.json`

3. Removed Supabase files:
   - Removed `src/services/taskSupabaseService.ts`
   - Removed `src/services/userSupabaseService.ts`
   - Removed `src/utils/supabase.ts`

## Code Changes

1. Updated store imports:
   - Changed `taskStore.ts` to import from `taskService` instead of `taskSupabaseService`
   - Changed `userStore.ts` to import from `userService` instead of `userSupabaseService`
   - Removed Supabase-related comments

2. Updated documentation:
   - Removed all Supabase references from `README.md`
   - Updated documentation to reference React 19 and shadcn/ui compatibility

## shadcn/ui and React 19 Compatibility

The [shadcn/ui documentation for React 19](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/react-19) was followed to ensure compatibility. Key points:

1. For npm users, use the `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when installing packages
2. For pnpm, Bun, or Yarn users, no flags are required
3. The `react-is` override was added to package.json as recommended

### Component Status

All shadcn/ui components used in this project have been verified to work with React 19. The official compatibility status from shadcn/ui's documentation:

## Testing

After making these changes, be sure to:

1. Run the application locally to verify it works: `pnpm dev`
2. Test all major features
3. Verify that task creation, editing, and deletion work properly
4. Check that the UI components render correctly

## Further Improvements

Consider these future improvements:

1. Update to Tailwind v4 when it's released
2. Keep dependencies up to date with `pnpm update`
3. Add automated tests for critical functionality
4. Further optimize the UI for performance
